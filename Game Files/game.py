Description:
This file is where the game is controlled from. It handles all screen activity
as well as all user input during gameplay. This file takes in data from settings.py,
ship.py, asteroid.py, explosion.py, and high_scores.py. After game is over it calls
game_over_screen.py and handles its inputs.
