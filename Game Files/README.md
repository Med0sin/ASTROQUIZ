# Run the game from the main file

The only thing that works right now is play

The ship an asteroids move around the screen and collide. Nothing other than a collision statement right now. 

### Need to implement:
-  what happens during collisions
-  Ship shooting
-  questions from asteroids
-  questions overall
-  questions menu
-  high score screen
-  score keeping
-  health
-  upgrades
-  settings screen
-  more asteroids
-  background
